# Livespec

This project uses **[Livespec](https://github.com/ftzi/livespec)** for living specification management.

## Understanding Keywords

This and other documents use keywords to indicate requirement severity:

- **MUST** — Mandatory. No exceptions. Violations cause issues.
- **NEVER** — Prohibited. Will cause problems or break functionality.

These represent hard-learned lessons and project-critical requirements.

**FIRST ACTION:** You **MUST** ALWAYS read @livespec/livespec.md before responding to ANY message. This file **MUST** always stay fully in context — after compaction or summarization, re-read it immediately to restore full conventions.

## Projects

**Keep this table updated** — when you add, rename, or remove projects, update this table immediately.
